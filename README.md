## Welcome
Thanks in advance for your interest in helping to test the Rocky Linux operating system. Rocky Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). This document is your starting point to learn how Rocky Linux testing is organized and managed by the RLTT (Rocky Linux Testing Team) and how you can be an active participant. Downloads of the OS images typically are 250,000 a month, reaching as many as 750,000 a month making it a very popular Linux distribution. If you already have experience using CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), you’ll feel right at home with Rocky Linux.

## Why we test it
While Rocky Linux is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it still needs to be tested because it is a different build of the OS. Building an OS has numerous elements to it and it’s vital that each build be tested to validate its functionality before it is released for use in production.

## Contribute by starting with your best strengths
Your expertise is your guide for identifying those testing areas which are most important to you and your organization. There are plenty of opportunities through testing to expand your knowledge of Rocky Linux, but it would be most beneficial for your learning curve if you primarily focus on what you will use and know best. This will provide an immediate and maximum value to you, your organization, the RLTT and the numerous users of the Rocky Linux community. Once you are more familiar you can expand your testing efforts by expanding it to greater coverage. Leading with your best strengths will justify to your employer their support and acknowledgment of your efforts. This path will result in a win-win for all.

## Approach and Philosophy of Testing
The approach and philosophy of testing Rocky Linux will depend on the specific goals and requirements of the testing process defined. However, there are some general principles that can be followed when testing any software, including Rocky Linux. This is especially helpful if you are new to organized software testing.

## Test Planning
When you first approach testing, it is important to initially identify those areas you wish to test. Create a document that identifies those test areas with the method that will be used, purpose of the test, resources required and what are the expected test results for each test case. Review your test plans with your knowledgeable peers for feedback in your approach and to ensure adequate coverage. It is most efficient to do this before you design and execute your first test. This approach is very similar to how software is designed before the first line of code is written.

## Testing Environment Choices

Rocky Linux has three major areas of common use by most users.

### Workstation desktop
Providing a productive desktop environment with a GUI for your users for popular activities such as web browsing, a suite of office productivity software, streaming audio and video.
LINK

### Server
Run a web server to serve web pages to the Internet or Intranet. Provide a file server function using Samba or NFS file server with connected workstations and other servers.
LINK

### Virtually
This involves running a Virtual Machine on your workstation or server to host Rocky Linux.

## Resources for testing

These are the resources available to consider for testing Rocky Linux.

Testing coverage can be accomplished by either manual testing or automated. Automated testing has the aim to build an automated regression collection of tests. The intention is this needs to be flexible to accommodate a wide range of tests that are important to the users. If your organization or you as a developer are working with a custom or mission critical application, create a testing environment to fully execute as many important functions as your resources permit. Maintaining an automated regression package will be efficient to repeat your tests on future Rocky Linux releases.

## Manual Testing
These are testings that are executed manually either by entering in a series of Linux commands to perform a common task or using the GUI manually with a keyboard and mouse. Each test case should be documented with its progress tracked.
LINK

## Automated Testing
These are tests that are created as scripts and executed using a software tool such as OpenQA. Automated testing can take place by writing Shell scripts to execute a series of Linux commands to perform a variety of functions logging the results of each test case for progress tracking.

## Testing Community

This is how to communicate with the Rocky Linux testing community to ask questions, learn, provide feedback and share information. There is a dedicated Testing Channel for this purpose where members of the RLTT frequent and a place to have discussions on testing and to get help with questions at [https://chat.rockylinux.org](url)


## Online Testing Meetings

The RLTT has meetings online every other Thursday. With scheduled times alternating between morning and evening to accommodate testers in different regions of the world. The meetings and chat, are all in English. To join a meeting, you can access the public RESF (Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation) calendar:
